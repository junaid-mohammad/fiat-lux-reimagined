<h1>About the project</h1>
<p class="mds-copy--lead">As McGill University commemorates its 200th anniversary in 2021, we have developed a bold vision to transform the Library into a cutting-edge nexus for teaching, learning and research in the digital age. The Fiat Lux Library Building Project is being realized through a combination of philanthropy and institutional support.</p>
<p>The words inscribed above the entrance to an early library building, <em>Fiat Lux [Let There Be Light]</em>, reflect the goal of this ambitious undertaking: to create a new Library complex that will accommodate exciting advances in technology-based learning and pedagogy, proactively positioning it to meet the needs of current and future McGill students, faculty and researchers.</p>
<p>The new Library complex will embrace McGill University’s rich past and integrate programming to address current space and service issues. Incorporating a rebuilt 1950s Redpath and renovated 1960s McLennan buildings, the modernized and expanded Library will be reconfigured to suit the study requirements of 21st-century library users – nearly doubling the spaces for the McGill community.</p>
<p>The renovated space will feature a variety of light-filled workspaces, themed reading rooms, and a completely re-imagined Rare and Special Collections. Next-generation, flexible learning environments will be created alongside an enhanced service model that reflects the need for amplified information and research expertise in the digital age.</p>
<p>The McGill Library is the busiest spot on campus and a home away from home for thousands of scholars each year. We are now reaching out to the Library’s community to lend support to this bicentennial project.</p>
